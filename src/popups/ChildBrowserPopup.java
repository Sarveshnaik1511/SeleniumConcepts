	// then we use one method from Iterator interface called next(); which give us data from the set
	// we have String generic data, so next method will give String type data
	// Scene set doen't follow sequence and it doesn't have sequence so to check whether set has more data we use one method,
	// it called hasNext() method, so it will check that the set has data or not
	// hasNext() method return boolean value, so if the data is available in set, it will return true and the next() method will get execute.
	
	// we use loop to get the address of webpage;
